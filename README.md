We were told to code the UV Sensor, IR Sensor and LDR Sensor with the help of any type of IDE(I used Arduino IDE)

We were also asked to automate the OpenCV problem.

We were also asked to watch the Andrew NG Machine Learning Course till week 9 which I have watched from this youtube playlist(https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)
